This Python script calculates the final price of an item based on an original price and a discount percentage entered by the user. The discount is applied only if the discount percentage is 20% or higher. Otherwise, the original price is returned.

Features

Applies the discount if it is 20% or more.

Returns the original price if the discount is below 20%.

Prompts the user to enter the original price and the discount percentage.

Prints the final price after applying the discount or the original price if no discount applies.

Usage
Save the script to a file named, for example, discount_calculator.py.

Run the script in a Python 3 environment:

bash
python discount_calculator.py
When prompted, input:

The original price of the item (as a number).

The script will output the final price after checking the discount condition.
